# Chat Site
## Description
A very simple implementation of a chat website

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to mess around with several new technologies such as react hooks, websockets, express, and heroku.

## Demo
Try it yourself [here](https://seans-chat-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Issues
- Theres a lot
- I have no idea how much load this will be able to handle.
- Sometimes the rooms do not get properly cleared out, so they just linger
- Sometimes when you try to join a room it doesn't work for some reason
- It's not horrible on mobile, but it isn't great either

## TODO's
- Add error handling everywhere
- Make look better
- Look into how the sockets are handled to see if that could be an issue
- Make it more stable
- Add tests
